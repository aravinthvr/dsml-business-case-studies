## üîß Steps Performed

### ‚úÖ 1. Data Cleaning & Exploration

- **Initial Review**: Loaded data, checked shape, data types, and basic statistics.
- **Irrelevant Columns**: Dropped unknown/irrelevant columns: `is_cutoff`, `cutoff_factor`, `cutoff_timestamp`, `factor`, `segment_factor`.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Converted timestamp columns (`trip_creation_time`, `od_start_time`, `od_end_time`) to datetime objects and relevant categorical columns to `category` type.
- **Missing Values**: Identified missing values in `source_name` and `destination_name`. Since the percentage was very low (<0.2%), rows with these missing values were dropped.
- **Duplicate Check**: Checked for duplicate rows (none found after initial processing).

### ‚úÖ 2. Feature Engineering

- **New Features Created** (primarily on aggregated data):
    - **`trip_time(mins)`**: Calculated as `(od_end_time - od_start_time)` in minutes.
    - **Location Features**:
        - `source_city`, `source_state`, `source_place`
        - `destination_city`, `destination_state`, `destination_place`
        - Extracted from `source_name` and `destination_name` using string manipulation and a predefined IATA code to city mapping for standardization.
    - **Temporal Features from `trip_creation_time`**:
        - `trip_creation_date`, `trip_creation_day` (of month), `trip_creation_month`, `trip_creation_week` (of year), `trip_creation_hour`.

### ‚úÖ 3. Data Aggregation

- **Objective**: Consolidate multiple segment rows for a single trip into one representative row.
- **`agg_df`**: Grouped data by `trip|src|dest` (a composite key of `trip_uuid`, `source_center`, `destination_center`). Used `first` or `last` aggregation for most fields, assuming these are consistent per defined trip segment group. This dataframe was used for most EDA and feature creation.
- **`agg_df_2`**: Grouped data by `trip_uuid`. For segment-specific metrics (`segment_actual_time`, `segment_osrm_time`, `segment_osrm_distance`), `sum` was used to get trip-level totals. Other fields used `first` or `last`. This dataframe was primarily used for hypothesis testing involving trip-level sums.

### ‚úÖ 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis**:
    - **Route Types**: Slightly more `Carting` trips (~53%) than `FTL` trips (~47%).
- **Bivariate Analysis & Temporal Trends**:
    - **Geographic Focus**: Maharashtra and Karnataka emerged as prominent states for both trip origins and destinations. Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Chennai were among the top cities.
    - **Trip Creation Hour**: Peaks observed late in the evening (around 22:00 hours).
    - **Trip Creation Day of Month**: Highest volume around the middle of the month (e.g., 17th).
    - **Trip Creation Week of Year**: A notable peak in trip volume during the 38th week of the year in this dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**:
    - Strong positive correlation between `trip_time(mins)` and `start_scan_to_end_scan`.
    - Positive correlations observed between actual distance/time and OSRM predicted distance/time.

### ‚úÖ 5. Hypothesis Testing (using `agg_df` or `agg_df_2` as appropriate)

Non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was used for comparing distributions due to non-normality of data (confirmed by Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots), even after log transformations were attempted. Significance level (alpha) = 0.05.

- **`trip_time(mins)` vs. `start_scan_to_end_scan`** (on `agg_df`):
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The two distributions are the same.
    - **Result**: Failed to reject Null Hypothesis (p-value > 0.05). Distributions are statistically similar.
- **Aggregated `actual_time` vs. Aggregated `osrm_time`** (trip-level sum from `agg_df_2`):
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The two distributions are the same.
    - **Result**: Rejected Null Hypothesis (p-value < 0.05). Distributions are statistically different.
- **Aggregated `actual_time` vs. Sum of `segment_actual_time`** (trip-level from `agg_df_2`):
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The two distributions are the same.
    - **Result**: Failed to reject Null Hypothesis. Summing segment actual times is consistent with the provided trip-level actual time.
- **Aggregated `osrm_distance` vs. Sum of `segment_osrm_distance`** (trip-level from `agg_df_2`):
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The two distributions are the same.
    - **Result**: Failed to reject Null Hypothesis. Summing segment OSRM distances is consistent.
- **Aggregated `osrm_time` vs. Sum of `segment_osrm_time`** (trip-level from `agg_df_2`):
    - **Null Hypothesis**: The two distributions are the same.
    - **Result**: Failed to reject Null Hypothesis. Summing segment OSRM times is consistent.

### ‚úÖ 6. Outlier Analysis

- **Detection**: Visualized using histograms and boxplots, showing right skewness in most numerical features. IQR method was used to quantify outliers.
- **Handling**: Outliers were identified but **retained** in the dataset, as they might represent genuine operational variations rather than errors.

## üí° Business Insights

1.  **Data Integrity & Preparation**:
    *   Successfully cleaned raw data by removing irrelevant columns and handling minimal missing entries.
    *   Standardized location data (city, state) enhances consistency for analysis.
2.  **Feature Engineering Value**:
    *   Newly created features like `trip_time(mins)` and granular temporal features (`trip_creation_hour`, `day`, `week`) provide richer dimensions for analysis and potential modeling.
3.  **Operational Patterns**:
    *   **Route Dominance**: `Carting` trips are slightly more frequent than `FTL`.
    *   **Key Geographies**: Operations are heavily concentrated in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
    *   **Peak Times**: Trip initiation is highest in the late evening. Mid-month and specifically the 38th week (in this dataset) show higher activity.
4.  **Performance & Prediction Metrics**:
    *   `start_scan_to_end_scan` is a statistically validated measure for overall trip duration, being similar to the calculated `trip_time(mins)`.
    *   There's a statistically significant difference between OSRM's predicted trip times and actual trip times, suggesting OSRM alone may not capture all real-world delays or factors.
    *   Aggregating segment-level data (actual time, OSRM distance, OSRM time) by summing them up provides a reliable trip-level view, consistent with provided trip-level totals.
5.  **Outliers**:
    *   Numerical features exhibit outliers, likely reflecting the inherent variability in logistics operations (e.g., exceptionally long or short trips due to various factors). These were retained for analysis.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1.  **Improve OSRM Accuracy/Utility**:
    *   Investigate the discrepancies between `actual_time` and `osrm_time`. Analyze trips with large deviations to identify contributing factors (e.g., specific routes, times of day, vehicle types, undocumented stops) not currently modeled by OSRM.
    *   Consider incorporating additional data sources (e.g., real-time traffic, weather) or calibrating OSRM parameters if possible.
2.  **Optimize Resource Allocation**:
    *   Align vehicle deployment, staffing, and warehouse operations with observed demand peaks: late evenings, mid-month periods, and historically busy weeks (like the 38th week).
3.  **Strategic Route & Network Focus**:
    *   Given the high trip volume in Maharashtra and Karnataka, prioritize route optimization efforts, infrastructure assessment, and potentially targeted service improvements in these states.
4.  **Data-Driven Reporting & Modeling**:
    *   Reliably use `start_scan_to_end_scan` (or the derived `trip_time(mins)`) for reporting and KPIs related to trip duration.
    *   When building predictive models (e.g., for ETA forecasting), be mindful of the OSRM deviations. Consider using actual historical times as a stronger baseline or feature.
    *   For models sensitive to outliers, evaluate robust statistical techniques or specific outlier treatment strategies if they are determined to be non-representative of the phenomena being modeled.
5.  **Further Investigation**:
    *   Deep-dive into the reasons for the trip surge in the 38th week (e.g., seasonal demand, specific campaigns, data collection period).
    *   Conduct a comparative performance analysis (e.g., time efficiency, cost-effectiveness if data available) between 'FTL' and 'Carting' route types across different regions or trip characteristics.
