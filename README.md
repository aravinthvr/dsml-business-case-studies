    *   Successfully aggregated multi-segment trip data into single trip records.
    *   Engineered crucial features like `actual_time_per_km`, `osrm_time_per_km`, `time_diff_osrm_actual`, `source_state`, `destination_state`, and various time-based features (hour, day, month).
    *   Analysis revealed discrepancies between actual and OSRM (estimated) logistics metrics, providing a basis for route and time estimation improvements.
    *   Identified patterns in delivery performance based on route types, time of day, and geographical factors.

### 07: Linear Regression - Jamboree Education Admission Prediction
*   **Objective:** Identify key factors influencing graduate school admissions, build a Linear Regression model to predict a student's "Chance of Admit," validate model assumptions, and provide actionable insights for students and Jamboree.
*   **Key Insights & Outcomes:**
    *   Significant predictors for "Chance of Admit" include GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, LOR strength, Undergraduate CGPA, and Research experience.
    *   Developed a Linear Regression model with an R-squared of ~0.82, indicating good predictive power.
    *   'SOP' (Statement of Purpose strength) was found to be less significant and potentially multicollinear, leading to its exclusion from the final model.
    *   Model assumptions (linearity, normality of residuals, multicollinearity via VIF) were validated.
    *   Recommendations: Students should focus on improving scores in identified key areas. Jamboree can use the model to enhance its admission prediction tool.

### 08: Logistic Regression - LoanTap Loan Default Prediction
